### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adair HernÃ¡ndez, I'm from Mexico and I'm 21 y/o.
Learning is one of my favorite activities and I'd like to become a web and mobile developer when I graduate.
This account is for storing my school projects, but I'm planning on including some personal projects too.
I'm interested in:
- Go
- Javascript
- React.js
- Flutter
